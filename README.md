# Audio-Visualizer: 
**Records and displays sound in the form of waveforms and spectrograms**

## Overview
This audio recorder and analyzer has been built using GUIDE in MATLAB. It is a simple yet powerful program for interactive display for sound visualization in the form of waveforms and spectrograms. It can read and write audio files in .wav format and run on any system with MATLAB R2012 and above. 

## Features: 
* Record: Microphone triggered audio-write, saves sampled data in vector form. 
* Browse: Displays content and properties of .wav files saved in the system. 
* Play Back: Sounds audio content from real-time recorded or pre-saved .wav files. 
* Waveform Plot: Plots the audio data as a function of time. 
* Spectrogram Plot: Plots intensity of frequency content as a Sonograph. 
* Screenshot: Saves analyzed figure to the system in .jpg format.
